I spent 2 months with PS5 — here's what I love and hate so far
(CNN) —   The past few months have been largely the same as ever during our new normal — I'm still living most of my social life on Discord, getting a record amount of dog-walking in and, of course, spending a lot of time on my couch playing video games. Except now I'm doing it with a powerful, giant new console that looks a lot like the Barclays Center sitting under my TV. I've been lucky enough to have Sony's new PlayStation 5 in my home for about two months now, and it's largely been a delight to use.

Cruise taps former Delta executive for COO post as it creeps towards commercialization
Cruise, the autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary of GM, said Friday it has hired Delta Air Lines' former chief operating officer Gil West as it makes the transition towards early commercialization. West, who had retired from Delta last year, will become Cruise's first chief operating officer. The announcement comes more than month after Cruise launched tests on public roads using autonomous vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The testing is still being conducted in a limited geographic area in San Francisco and in one of the city's less congested neighborhoods, but it is was still viewed as a milestone for the company and a necessary step to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.
