I spent 2 months with PS5 — here's what I love and hate so far
(CNN) —   The past few months have been largely the same as ever during our new normal — I'm still living most of my social life on Discord, getting a record amount of dog-walking in and, of course, spending a lot of time on my couch playing video games. Except now I'm doing it with a powerful, giant new console that looks a lot like the Barclays Center sitting under my TV. I've been lucky enough to have Sony's new PlayStation 5 in my home for about two months now, and it's largely been a delight to use.

Cruise taps former Delta executive for COO post as it creeps towards commercialization
Cruise, the autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary of GM, said Friday it has hired Delta Air Lines' former chief operating officer Gil West as it makes the transition towards early commercialization. West, who had retired from Delta last year, will become Cruise's first chief operating officer. The announcement comes more than month after Cruise launched tests on public roads using autonomous vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The testing is still being conducted in a limited geographic area in San Francisco and in one of the city's less congested neighborhoods, but it is was still viewed as a milestone for the company and a necessary step to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.

What is up with Tesla's value?
The last year taught us that the connection between the stock market and the economy is imprecise at best. Despite some useful commentary underscoring the two are at least somewhat linked, it's clear that many Americans can lose their jobs and financial security at the same time that stocks can keep on rising like the boom times will never end. It seems that today's market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.

And yes, working hard to sell ads, because that's what Yahoo! did. It gathered data and it served pages and it sold ads. We watched Yahoo! get eclipsed in size and reach by Google... a more efficient and more profitable ad seller. They knew what you were searching for, so they could gather your data more efficiently and sell better ads.

What is up with Tesla's value?
The last year taught us that the connection between the stock market and the economy is imprecise at best. Despite some useful commentary underscoring the two are at least somewhat linked, it's clear that many Americans can lose their jobs and financial security at the same time that stocks can keep on rising like the boom times will never end. It seems that today's market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.

Hyundai Elevate: ‘The world's first walking car'
T his ‘quadrupedal' vehicle may look like a smart shopping trolley ready for a supermarket dash in some distant interstellar community. But, in fact, it's a full-size, robotic walking car, which Hyundai believes may be helpful in rescue zones when normal vehicles, even the most robust 4x4s, just can't hack it. It's called the ‘Elevate' and by blending technology found in modern electric cars with advanced robotics, it can climb up 5ft walls, straddle a 5ft hole and step across piles of debris, thanks to the addition of four fully articulated robotic legs – and all the while keeping its passengers completely level.

Review: Mixbook focuses on quality photo prints, books, and cards

What you will find is photo prints, wall art, calendars, and a particularly deep selection of the best photo books and best photo cards. Quality seems to be Mixbook's priority, over price and selection. I do think Mixbook is one of the overall best online photo printing services, even if you're just using an iPhone 12. But the site could definitely be smoother, as I'll explain in this Mixbook Photo Printing review. Note: Since this review was initially written, Mixbook has made updates to the website, making photo book creation much smoother.

That call to arms is just one of the many warning signs on extremist sites and mainstream social media platforms that extremism experts say were easy to spot but ultimately disregarded by law enforcement in the runup to Wednesday's riot at the Capitol, which led to the deaths of five people, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick , 42, who was reportedly hit with a fire extinguisher during the melee.

It's A Colorful World, & Your PS5 Controller Can Be A Part Of It
The DualSense controller for the PS5 is an excellent work of art that the engineers at Sony have bestowed upon gamers, but its lack of colorful options can make it look and feel somewhat bland at times. Not to mention dirty (that white really picks up on dirt and oils very easily).But your controller can still be a part of this colorful world that we live in even if Sony isn't providing you with the options. ColorWare, a company that specializes in giving all sorts of technology their own customized paint jobs, will sell you a colorful PS5 controller that is as colorful as you may have been hoping.

Can I buy a phone that doesn't use anything from Google or Apple?
I have concerns about the likes of Google and Apple slurping up as much info as they can about me from my phone. I've tried looking online for alternatives and found mentions of things like /e/, Lineage, Sailfish OS etc, but they assume a level of tech knowledge far above what I have as a layman. So, are there any phones that are 100% free from Google and Apple software and hardware? How easy are such phones to obtain? Steve Very easy. You can pick up a Nokia 105 (2017 edition) for about £15 or a dual-sim Nokia 106 (2018 edition) for about £16.

Google removes Parler from app store, could also be removed from Apple's if it doesn't implement a moderation plan
CLOSE President Trump's final Tweet read, 'To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.' USA TODAYGoogle removed the social media app Parler Friday evening because it posed a "public safety threat."The social network, launched in 2018, became popular among conservatives and an unmoderated home to more extreme views in 2020 when both Facebook and Twitter tightened up their content moderation and labeling."In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence," said a Google spokesperson in a statement to USA TODAY.

Parler is one of the hottest apps in the world, a social network that has attracted millions of conservatives over the past year with its hands-off approach to policing users' posts. And with the news that President Trump had been kicked off Twitter and Facebook, Parler was the odds-on bet to be his next soapbox. But just as it was gaining new clout, Parler is now suddenly faced with an existential crisis. On Friday, Apple told the company that it had to step up its policing of the conversation on its app — undercutting its flagship feature — or lose its platform on iPhones.

For several months, I have been able to watch TV with sound, by starting a video on the Mac, then connecting the HDMI cable to the TV. But for some reason, that won't work anymore. I'm having what seems like a common problem - namely, the picture is fine, but there's no sound. I've researched all over, and none of the suggested remedies work. System Preferences/Sound/Output just shows ‘headphones' but does not show any other options.

The tweets promptly disappeared from the account. The message from the President briefly appeared on the @POTUS account before disappearing. It is not clear if Trump or another person with access to the account deleted the posts, or if Twitter did so itself. In the posts, Trump said that he was in talks with other sites and is also looking at the possibility of building his own platform.

Capitol Hill siege: Twitter bans Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell
Twitter has banned President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn and pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell as part of a purge of QAnon accounts following the storming of the US Capitol by a mob of violent Trump supporters. Social media companies have been under intensified pressure to crack down on hate speech after Wednesday's attack on the Capitol. Dozens of QAnon social media accounts were hyping up January 6 in the days leading up to a Washington DC rally for Trump, expressing hope that President-elect Joe Biden's victory would be overturned.

Looking forward to the Galaxy S21? Here's everything we know so far!
2020 saw the release of some truly impressive Android phones, one of the best Android phones being the Galaxy S20 from Samsung. The S20 set out to deliver on every front that it could, and for the most part, it succeeded with flying colors. It's now been almost a year since the S20 came out, though, which means it's time to start looking ahead. The smartphone industry moves at a rapid pace, and in just a few days, it'll be time for the Galaxy S21. Whether you're interested in specs, design renders, pricing info, or anything else, here's everything we know so far about the Samsung Galaxy S21! Unmatched Samsung Galaxy S20 One of the best Android phones you can buy in 2020 We're just as excited about the Galaxy S21 as you are, but if you need a phone right now, don't feel like you have to wait months for it.

Twitter permanently suspends @TeamTrump after the account posted quotes from Trump's now removed @POTUS tweets, says evading suspension is against its rules (Jack Morse/Mashable)
Jack Morse / Mashable: Twitter permanently suspends @TeamTrump after the account posted quotes from Trump's now removed @POTUS tweets, says evading suspension is against its rules — Twitter kept its word. — After permanently suspending the @realDonaldTrump account late Friday, Twitter also moved to suspend the @TeamTrump account.

The Tweets That Got Trump Banned Were Far From His Worst
I always figured that if Donald Trump got banned from Twitter, it would be for one of two reasons. Either he would tweet something beyond the pale even for him—an explicit death threat, say—or he would leave the White House and stop benefiting from Twitter's lenient rules for public figures. Neither scenario is how Trump's Twitter career finally came to an apparent end. On Friday night, with just 12 days left in his presidency and two days after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol, leading to several deaths, Twitter said it had permanently suspended Trump's account 'due to the risk of further incitement of violence.

Parler pitched itself as Twitter without rules. Apple and Google said not anymore
Written by Jack Nicas Parler is one of the hottest apps in the world, a social network that has attracted millions of conservatives over the past year with its hands-off approach to policing users' posts. And with the news that President Donald Trump had been kicked off Twitter and Facebook, Parler was the odds-on bet to be his next soapbox. But just as it was gaining new clout, Parler is now suddenly faced with an existential crisis.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png On Friday, Apple told the company that it had to step up its policing of the conversation on its app — undercutting its flagship feature — or lose its platform on iPhones.

Google bans Parler from Android app store
Enlarge / Google's corporate headquarters. Google has banned the conservative social media app Parler from its Play Store for Android.

Google suspends 'free speech' app Parler
Google has suspended "free speech" social network Parler from its Play Store over its failure to remove "egregious content". Parler styles itself as "unbiased" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter. But Google said the app had failed to remove posts inciting violence. Apple has also warned Parler it will remove the app from its App Store if it does not comply with its content-moderation requirements. On Parler, the app's chief executive John Matze said: "We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!" Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives.

Best gaming laptops for 2021
A gamer knows that there's more to a gaming laptop than raw speed. You can pack a gaming laptop with the best graphics card, the fastest, most colorful display around, a gazillion-core processor, tons of fast solid-state drive storage to hold your games, and a rock-solid hard drive for secondary storage -- and it can still fall short. Those powerful components may overheat at the worst moments or you might experience some instability that impacts your gaming performance. Or maybe you don't want to always use an external mechanical keyboard , but the built-in backlit keyboard feels like mashed potatoes under your WASD keys .

Republican mega-donor buys stake in Twitter and seeks to oust Jack Dorsey
A major Republican donor has purchased a stake in Twitter and is reportedly seeking to oust its chief executive, Jack Dorsey . Bloomberg News first reported that Elliott Management has taken a 'sizable stake' and 'and plans to push for changes at the social media company, including replacing Dorsey'. Paul Singer, the billionaire founder of Elliott Management , is a Republican mega-donor who opposed Donald Trump during the real-estate magnate's run for the presidential nomination but has since come onside .

Man buys $27 of bitcoin, forgets about them, finds they're now worth $886k
The meteoric rise in bitcoin has meant that within the space of four years, one Norwegian man's $27 investment turned into a forgotten $886,000 windfall. Kristoffer Koch invested 150 kroner ($26.60) in 5,000 bitcoins in 2009, after discovering them during the course of writing a thesis on encryption. He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency in April 2013 jogged his memory. Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten.

Twitter had been Mr Trump's communication method of choice, a seemingly non-stop stream of grievances, displays of support and warnings to his enemies.

Man buys $27 of bitcoin, forgets about them, finds they're now worth $886k
The meteoric rise in bitcoin has meant that within the space of four years, one Norwegian man's $27 investment turned into a forgotten $886,000 windfall. Kristoffer Koch invested 150 kroner ($26.60) in 5,000 bitcoins in 2009, after discovering them during the course of writing a thesis on encryption. He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency in April 2013 jogged his memory. Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten.

Google Play suspends Parler until app develops moderation policies
Google suspended the social media platform Parler on Friday from its Google Play app store until the 'Twitter for conservatives' adopts content moderation policies following the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump supporters. Parler, founded in 2018, has found traction among conservative users looking for alternatives to more mainstream apps like Facebook and Twitter, which moderate content more rigorously. Parler has banned users for trolling conservatives but doesn't have a formal set of moderation policies.

This gesture-sensing band could make the Apple Watch more accessible
When Wearable Devices, the startup that's behind the Mudra Band, first pitched the device to Indiegogo backers, it did so by playing up the fact it could let you use the Apple Watch without touching it with your non-watch hand. But the company told Engadget it's been working on accessibility use cases as well. In one instance, they built a proof of concept that allows ALS patients to quickly type using a virtual keyboard. In another example, the company used the wearable to give an IDF veteran whose injury left them with a heavily clenched fist the chance to learn to play the piano.
